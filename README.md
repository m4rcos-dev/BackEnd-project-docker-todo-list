<p>Project developed during the back-end module of the Trybe full-stack web development course.</p>
<p>A <a href='https://github.com/tryber/sd-023-b-project-docker-todo-list/tree/master/docker/todo-app'>full-stack application</a> was used in this repository: a task application! This application was containerized to work in any environment and hardware using docker. Configuration files were developed for each specific front: Front-end, Back-end and, in our case, for a test application that validates if the applications are communicating.</p>
<p>We created the images for the applications and configured these images with docker-compose.</p>
